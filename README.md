# IceNine

An editor that could ruin the whole system, but that probably isn't possible

# Influences

emacs, acme, plan 9 from bell labs

# Theory

I want to try my hand at designing and building a fundamental
tool for myself. The world may not need another text editor,
but I want a project designing a tool for myself.

# Ideas

* Parallel nested read, eval, and print (presentation, abstraction, control?).
* event sourcing of commands (kafka?)
  * save the whole tree forever, how much data is this? is this unfeasible?
  * could be interesting to save for analysis or archeology
* Consider where content addressable storage could play a role
